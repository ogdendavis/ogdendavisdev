      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>
        I love writing software because the process combines all the best parts
        of helping a friend, solving a puzzle, and writing a novel: I get to
        create solutions to real-world problems that people face, engage my
        creative thinking and problem-solving skills, and craft an experience
        and message that uniquely guide the end-user through the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a full-stack web application engineer, I get to do all of that while
        working with cutting-edge web technology that's always evolving -- the
        continuous process of learning new things and applying that knowledge
        keeps me engaged, motivated, and having fun with my work!
